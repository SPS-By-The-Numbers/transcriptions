0	All right Director McLaren stepped out just a moment she will be back momentarily.
1	We will go ahead and start with, I am just going to read the action item number off the one that is in front of me.
2	It says it is one I guess it is actually two and that is the 2015-16 state legislative agenda.
3	This is coming out of the executive committee and if we could have it read into the record and seconded and then we can discuss.
4	I move that the school board adopt the 2015-16 legislative agenda as attached to the board action report.
5	I second.
6	Thank you for the second.
7	Alright so this came through the executive committee and we had previously approved, we had approved the previous version for approval, recommended for approval but it's been changed so it's for consideration but by the whole board and with that I'm going to ask Ken Gotch to please speak to the changes.
8	Ken Gotch assistant superintendent for business and finance.
9	Since the introduction of this item we received several suggestions from board members, members of the public and our lobbyists.
10	Essentially the modifications we made was to make sure that one of our three goals specifically addressed the district's capacity needs and the capital funding needs of the district.
11	In addition we added several items including enhancing or specifically referencing the goal of our district as including every student, every classroom, every day.
12	We were asked to make sure that we spell out fully funding McCleary as our very first goal.
13	We also added specific language that addresses fixing the levy cliff now, not waiting until next session.
14	We also requested the state to fund measures to reduce eliminate disproportionate suspension.
15	And we also added some language asking the state to reconsider how smarter balance is used in scores for high stakes purpose testing in the next two years.
16	Those are essentially the changes that were made from the last meeting.
17	Alright thank you for that.
18	So let's open it up to questions and I saw Director Blanford's hand first.
19	If I remember correctly when this was first put forward there was the idea that less is more and that a tight focus might result in more efficacy actually on the floor of the legislature or wherever it is that folks are making decisions.
20	And so I'm wondering given the laundry list that you just read, laundry list is the wrong word that sounds judgmental and I don't mean for it to.
21	But given the length of the additions do we lose something?
22	We are still staying within the three basic goal principle and I think the executive team felt that the clear statements on McCleary, emphasizing capital certainly made good sense.
23	And then I think it gave us an opportunity to include some of the board's recent actions and making sure that we were reflecting some of the priorities of the board and encompassed within those three overall goals.
24	So the recent board action on reducing disproportionate suspensions, we know there is a cost to that action.
25	gives us a chance to at least remind our legislators that they could help us in that area we certainly would appreciate it.
26	Director Peasley.
27	So it says Seattle has three priorities for this session but then it only lists two priorities.
28	The third priority is closing the opportunity gap.
29	Okay so it's outside of the box.
30	It's an outside of the box priority.
31	I'm sure we can fix the typesetting.
32	I know my version it's in the box.
33	So the levy, fixing the levy cliff was among the three priorities and now it's gotten bumped down and it's underneath fully funding McCleary.
34	It's one of those either ors if you recall I think the consensus of the superintendents in the Puget Sound area was we should really be lobbying to get the state to fully fund education but if they don't fully fund it make sure they fix the levy cliffs so that districts aren't harmed by the loss of the potential local levy dollars.
35	And we're just making sure that in our particular agenda that we're adopting tonight that we're making that more visible in the discussion this fall and in the next spring.
36	Okay thank you.
37	Others?
38	Director Blanford.
39	I just want to be sure that we, that as explicitly as I can state it, that working on the achievement or opportunity gap is not outside of the box.
40	That's got to be hugely prioritized and if the box needs to be expanded let's make sure and do that.
41	Yes sir.
42	Director Peters.
43	I got it right this time.
44	Well I appreciate the effort that went into tweaking this a little bit more and taking some more input because I think the result here is a nice balance of some general requests and some specifics.
45	I think it is important to send a message to Olympia what sort of work we are doing specifically and where our challenges are.
46	I also think it is important to remind our legislators that some of these things we are trying to fund are mandates that come from them.
47	And so everything having to do with smarter balance is a good example of that.
48	And so I think it's important to have some details in a document like this.
49	Thank you.
50	Any other questions or comments from directors?
51	All right seeing none let's go ahead and call the roll Ms. Fodey.
52	Director Peters.
53	Aye.
54	Director Blanford.
55	Aye.
56	Director Martin-Morris.
57	Aye.
58	Director McLaren.
59	Aye.
60	Director Patu.
61	Aye.
62	Director Peasley.
63	Aye.
64	Director Karr.
65	Aye.
66	This motion has passed unanimously.
67	All right so the next item on the agenda was the transportation service standards and bill times that has been delayed for November 18. So that takes us to the restructuring of the partnership with the Alliance for Education.
68	And that is coming out of the executive committee and it doesn't appear that there's been any changes to the document since introduction and so we talked about the document as it was introduced.
69	Oh I'm sorry I got ahead of myself here.
70	Let's go ahead and read the motion into the record and have a second.
71	I move that the board authorize the superintendent to restructure how SPS partners with the alliance and hereby authorizes the superintendent to end all or part of SPS's relationship with the alliance depending upon SPS's needs and or SPS's ability to handle assume or outsource the work being done by the alliance including but not limited to any authorization for the alliance to fundraise on behalf of SPS and or use SPS's name or logo in any fundraising efforts.
72	I second the motion.
73	All right thank you.
74	So now it's been read in and seconded and covered the other stuff so let's go to questions and comments from directors.
75	So Director Peasley.
76	So my question is in the communications we've received from members of the alliance they're basically saying they're going to continue doing business as usual in spite of this.
77	So given what I just read in the form of a motion, how can they continue to do business as usual?
78	Good evening John Sirk, we act in general counsel.
79	So that's probably a better question for the CEO of the alliance as far as what they mean by that but what I think the intent is is that Director Karr and Dr. Nyland will send a communication if this is approved to the alliance probably relinquishing the seats on their board and informing them not to fundraise on behalf of the district unless we can partner and agree to like for example the Seattle teacher residency program in the letter back from the alliance they said they will do it for the original sum of $50,000 versus the prior commitment I think for this year was $200,000 plus.
80	So we'll need to enter into a contract with them if that's what Dr. Nyland wishes to do with respect to the STR.
81	So we'll need to specifically delineate in a letter to them that based on this action please do not do A, B, and C.
82	And I don't know what they mean by they'll continue to do what they do.
83	I suppose they could raise funds and offer them up and if they're not raising on our behalf like for STR in general then we'll need to look at that on a case-by-case basis.
84	Let me just ask for a little bit of clarification.
85	Given this action that we are about to take, exactly how will we be engaging with the alliance in any particular manner?
86	Will every single fundraising effort require a contract, an agreement?
87	How will it work going forward?
88	Ken Gatz, assistant superintendent for business and finance.
89	I know from a grants perspective we'll follow our grants protocol just like we would with any other agency in the state or in the city of Seattle.
90	I was stepping up to the microphone to also kind of remind you that we have PTAs and booster clubs that really support our schools on a daily basis that rely on the Alliance for the various account services and some of their fundraising services that they provide.
91	I spoke with the Ingram principal today before this meeting just to check with him.
92	He was one of the active users of the Alliance services and he's been very pleased with the support that his booster clubs and PTAs get through the alliance and we're not, I'm assuming we're not discouraging that from happening.
93	Those are important services, they're independent of the district and we certainly wouldn't want that to stop.
94	So I'm envisioning that those would be some of the activities that they'll still support the district on through these various independent groups.
95	So I'll offer my perspective on the answer.
96	I think what it is, so based on the recommendation I got from the city that we need to look at something more like an annual contract where you have a conversation, what do you want to cover the coming year, you put it under contract for that year.
97	and you do it on a year-by-year basis so that it's clear, it's bounded, there's no confusion about what the scope of work is so that we don't have continual misunderstandings about work that's being pursued that the leadership's not aware of and so forth.
98	So I would say that would be my recommendation on how to go forward is you button it down, put it in a contract and manage it as a contract like you would the relationship with the city or with any other supplier, however you want to characterize it, that we do business with.
99	Rather than this relationship-based agreement.
100	Okay.
